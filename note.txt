For client side, you can use DatagramSocket() constructor and it will bind to any random port.

For the server side, you neet to use the DatagramSocket(int port) to bind it to a specific port

bind() method ????

In DatagramSocket for the client, in the connect method, you CONNECT TO THE ROUTER NOT SERVER

DatagramSocket() has a send method which takes aDatagramPAcket.
The DatagramPAcket object is you custom made packet which is essentially a buffer (array) of bytes and the total length in big endian.

Instead of connecting the datagramSocket, you can use a specific send method which takes a socketAdress (your router).

initial estimated RTT is static and given by you. You can use estimated RTT and increment it using the formula.


when client send a packet, the timer starts
estimated RTT = 10s
DevRTT = 0s
Global timer = 4 * DevRTT + estimated RTT


sampleRTT = 5s
Global timer = new estimated RTT + 4 * DevRTT
and new estimated RTT = (1 - 0.125) * estimatedRTT + 0.125 * sample RTT




Change HTTPC for upd
Change httpfs for UDP

test to make sure it works at least ine message
